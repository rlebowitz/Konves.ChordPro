[G] [C] [G] [C] 
It was a [G] rainy night when he [Bm] came into sight,
[C] standing by the road, no um-[G]brella, no coat.
So I pulled up along side and I [Bm] offered him a ride,
he [C] accepted with a smile, so we [D] drove for a while.
{c: }
I didn't [G] ask him his name, this lonely [Em] boy in the rain.
Fate [C] tell me it's right, is this love at first sight.
Please, [D] don't make it wrong, just stay for the night.
{c: }
[G] All I wanna do is make love to you. [C] Say you will you want me, too.
[G] All I wanna do is make love to you. I've got [C] lovin' arms to hold on to.
{c: }
So we [G] found this hotel, it was a [Bm] place I knew well.
We [C] made magic that night. Oh, he did [G] everything right.
He brought the woman out of me, so many [Bm] times, easily.
And in the [C] morning when he woke, all I [D] left him was a note.
{c: }
I told him [G] I am the flower you are the seed,
we [Em] walked in the garden, we planted a tree.
Don't [C] try to find me, please don't you dare,
just [D] live in my memory, you'll always be there.
{c: }
[G] All I wanna do is make love to you, one [C] night of love was all we knew.
[G] All I wanna do is make love to you, I've got [C] lovin' arms to hold on to
[D] Oh, oooh, we made [Em] love, love like strangers.
[C] All night long we made [G] love.
{c: }
Then it [Bm] happened one day, we came round the same way.
[C] You can imagine his surprise when he [D] saw his own eyes.
I said [G] please, please understand, I'm in [Em] love with another man.
And what [C] he couldn't give me, was the [D] one little thing that you can.
{c: }
[G] All I wanna do is make love to you, one [C] night of love was all we knew.
[G] All I want to do is make love to you.
[C] Come on, say you will, you want me, too.
{c: }
[G] All I wanna do is make love to you, one [C] night of love was all we knew.
[G] All I want to do is make love to you.
[C] Come on, say you will, you want me, too.
All night [G] long, All night [C] long
All night [G] long, All night [C] long
[G] All I wanna do. All I wanna do, [C] All I wanna do. All I wanna do
[G] All I wanna do is make love to you, one [C] night of love was all we knew [G]
