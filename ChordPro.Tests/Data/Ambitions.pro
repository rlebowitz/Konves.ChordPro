[F] 

Now, I [F] can't behave         
I feel it in my feet on the [Am] streets
But don't you [Bb] know?
There's something I can feel when I [F] breathe 
 
I [F] told you once you're breaking into separate [Am] parts
But don't you [Bb] know?
It's something that I can't live with-[Dm]out 
 
And if [Bb] somebody's going to [F] make it
Then this [Dm] somebody ought to be [Am] you
And I [Bb] keep telling my re-[F]flection
Am[Dm] bitions are [C] already starting to [F] fade 
 
I can't [F] tolerate the feelings that I feel when I [Am] feel
But don't you [Bb] know?
Some feelings never seem to let [F] go
 
Like a [F] silverblade I cut my way out of con-[Am]trol
But don't you [Bb] know?
Some blades will cut you right to the [Dm] bone
 
And if [Bb] somebody's going to [F] make it
Then this [Dm] somebody ought to be [C] you
And if [Bb] somebody's going to [F] fake it
Then this [C] somebody, somebody is you
If it's [Bb] me that was going to [F] take it
Then I [Dm] know that it wouldn't be straight
And I [Bb] keep telling my re-[F] flection
Am-[C] bitions are [C]  already starting to [F] fade
 
I can't [F] tolerate-- 
 
And if [Bb] somebody's going to [F] make it
Then this [Dm] somebody ought to be [C] you
And if [Bb] somebody's going to [F] fake it
Then this [C] somebody, somebody is you
If it's [Bb] me that was going to [F] take it
Then I [Dm] know that it wouldn't be straight
And I [Bb] keep telling my re-[F]flection
Am-[C] bitions are[C]  already starting to [F] fade 
 
And I [Bb] keep telling my re-[F]flection
Am-[Dm]bitions are [C] already starting to [F] fade
